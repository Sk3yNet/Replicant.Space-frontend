"""App version, change history and server-run tracking.

Every automation log entry and job is stamped with the version and the server run that wrote it, so anything from
an older version or an earlier run can be told apart. Each start appends a run record ({run, version, fingerprint,
started_at, last_seen, stopped_at}) and logs a "server started" note, including what changed since the previous
version and whether the previous run stopped cleanly (no stopped_at = it was killed / crashed / redeployed hard).

`fingerprint` is a short hash of the app's code, so a code change shows up even if VERSION wasn't bumped.
Bump VERSION and add a CHANGES entry with every release.
